# Network_UserAction_log_analysis


This project involves the analysis of network and user action logs for an IT group within a multinational company. The primary objective is to gain insights into user behavior, device usage, and application usage patterns.




## Data Description
The dataset includes various event types and captures the following information:

1) Device MAC
2) Date and time
3) Data centre
4) Variable data in a description field


Most users in this dataset work on one file at a time, saving and closing it before starting a new file or opening another.
## Event Types
1) Workstation (cabled to the network) startup and shutdown
2) Wi-Fi connected devices that connect or disconnect
3) User logins and logouts
4) User file saves/closes and file new/opens
5) User use of MS Office, a browser, and other apps
6) User work breaks and lunch breaks
## Methodology

* Data Cleaning: Preprocess the data to handle missing values, incorrect entries, and any inconsistencies.
* Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (count, mean, min, max) for each user and device.
* Time Calculations: Calculating log times to accurately profile user activities.
* Data Modeling: Develop models to analyze MS Office usage and other application patterns.
* Visualization: Create visualizations to represent user behavior and device usage effectively.

## Conclusion


This analysis provides valuable insights into user behavior and device usage within the organization. By understanding these patterns, the IT group can make informed decisions to improve network efficiency and user productivity.
